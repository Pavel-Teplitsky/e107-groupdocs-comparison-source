If you have Microsoft Word 2003 (DOC), youll find it difficult to view Microsoft Word 2010 documents (DOCX). Although the compressed file format (DOCX) has been around for a while, not everyone can read it. You can overcome this hurdle if you use GroupDocs comparison as its a perfect Word comparison. The same is true for a lot of other formats. GroupDocs comparison overcomes that problem by taking documents in all kinds of formats and showing them on screen. You don't need to have the program that created a document to read it. This means that you can share documents without worrying about what programs your colleagues have. Through GroupDocs comparison, you can view almost any document and see it the way it was meant to look.

= Search for text in a document. Select text from documents you are viewing quickly and easily and copy it to the clipboard. =
Remember a paragraph you wrote that perfectly sums up your company objectives? Search the document to find the text and then copy it. You can re-use text from different documents, all of them stored online. If you have boilerplate - paragraphs and descriptions that you re-use a lot - you can put them into a document and share it with your colleagues. Now everyone has access to the same text, and your look consistent and professional. When boilerplate is stored and shared online, you can make changes locally and share them with your colleagues so that everyone works from the same version.

= Move between the pages of your document quickly with our thumbnail page preview. =
If youre familiar with PDF files, or Microsoft Word, youll be used to navigating documents using thumbnails. Each page in a document is shown as a small picture to give you an overview of the content. To read a page, click it. Thumbnails make navigating any document easy. You can find a particular image or the next chapter of a book without having to know what page it is on.
